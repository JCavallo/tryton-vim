    - Filetype detection for python and xml files which are part of a tryton
      project
    - Specific indentation file for python files which match the project
      guidelines
    - Syntax and Folding files for python files
    - Xml validation / formatting (requires xmllint available)
    - Code Snippets (requires *UltiSnips* )
    - Code Search Patterns (requires *unite* )

        This variable is used to declare the location of the trytond folder.
        It is necessary for xml validation features, as we use the rng
        validation files from this folder.

        and fail if not available

        default: not set

        default: 1

g:tryton_xml_indent                                 *g:tryton_xml_indent*

        Defines the indentation to use for xml formatting.

        default: "    "

g:tryton_grep_command                               *g:tryton_grep_command*

        The base command to use for search features

        default: 'Unite grep:.:-inR:'
